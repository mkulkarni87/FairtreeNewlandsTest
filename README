What did I try?

mkulkarni87 starts a GitHub repo(sitory). GitHub syncs with GitHub desktop app.

Desktop app lets you create new files play around with them etc. Then you 'commit' changes.

Then I wanted to try something out, so you start a 'branch' because you don't want to change the 'master'.

I made minor changes and then did a 'pull request'. 'branch' merges with 'master', various options.

Adding a collaborator (email is sent to them to accept), organization view with GitHub Enterprise

Collaborator makes changes to existing files, adds files. 'Pull request' to add changes. User permissions.

Desktop app features
